# AISGv2 Plan

## ‚úÖ **Current Status**
Voice trait selector built and integrated into brand details page. Tasks 1-5 complete - core MVP functionality working end-to-end. Added formality level (Very Casual ‚Üí Very Formal) and reading level (Grade 6-8, 10-12, 13+) dropdowns with full data flow from UI ‚Üí localStorage ‚Üí API ‚Üí AI prompts. Voice traits now use static content instead of AI generation for consistency.

## üéØ **Next Tasks (Priority Order)**

### **Core MVP (Tasks 1-5)** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Trait selection, persistence, backend wiring, PDF generation all working end-to-end.

### **User Experience (Priority 6-8) - Polish & Flow**
6. **UI Polish**
   - Polish trait selector visual feedback.
   - Add loading states during generation.
   - Improve error messaging.

7. **Analytics Setup**
   - Track trait selection patterns.
   - Monitor conversion from trait selection ‚Üí signup.
   - A/B test different trait combinations.

### **Advanced Features (Priority 8+) - Enhancements**
8. **Smart Defaults**
   - Suggest traits based on brand description.
   - Pre-select likely combinations.
   - Show "brands like yours chose..." hints.

9. **Trait Combinations**
   - Add validation for conflicting traits.
   - Suggest complementary trait sets.
   - Show preview of how traits work together.

10. **Custom Traits**
    - Allow users to define custom traits.
    - Expand beyond the 12 predefined options.
    - Industry-specific trait suggestions.

## üìù **Notes**
- Focus on user confidence and control over the style guide output
- Each selected trait should visibly impact the final PDF content
- Prioritize simple, effective implementations

## üéØ **Vision & Problem**
Transform AIStyleGuide from "quick generator" to "professional copywriter tool". Current flow optimized for speed but copywriters need **depth and confidence**. Users won't pay without seeing proof the tool understands good writing and their specific brand.

**Core insight:** Style guide rules should support the brand voice. A playful brand voice will have rules like "you can use emojis."

---

## üöÄ **Simplified User Journey**
1. **Landing ‚Üí Brand Details Page** (keep existing URL extraction)
2. **Enhanced Brand Details** - add voice trait selection (12 trait pills, pick 3)
3. **Live Preview** - see trait rules immediately as you select
4. **Generate PDF** - comprehensive style guide with selected traits

**Why better:** Immediate value in 30 seconds vs 3+ minutes. No complex questionnaire. Users see quality before paying.

---

## üèó **Implementation Details**

### **Voice Traits (12 total)**
Bold, Human, Playful, Expert, Dry-humor, Warm, Minimal, Quirky, Inspirational, Rebellious, Analytical, Wholesome

### **Technical Files**
- `lib/traits.ts` - trait definitions ‚úÖ 
- `components/TraitCard.tsx` - individual trait display ‚úÖ
- `components/VoiceTraitSelector.tsx` - pill picker + live cards ‚úÖ
- `app/brand-details/page.tsx` - integrated form ‚úÖ
- `app/api/generate-style-guide/route.ts` - needs trait support

### **Copy Audit (Separate Feature)**
- Available at `/audit-test` for copywriters who want analysis
- Not integrated into main flow (too complex)
- Future potential as add-on service

---

## üìä **Success Metrics**
- Trait selection completion rate
- Brand-details ‚Üí PDF conversion  
- User satisfaction with trait rules
- Performance: PDF in < 5 seconds

---

## üéØ **Vision Statement**
Transform AIStyleGuide from "quick generator" to "professional copywriter tool" that builds trust through analysis-first approach and proves value before payment. The way I think about Style Guide is that the rules are there to support the brand voice. For example, a playful brand voice will likely have a rule that you can use emojis. 


## üìã **Core Problem Solved**
Current flow optimized for speed but copywriters need **depth and confidence**. Users won't pay without seeing proof the tool understands good writing and their specific brand.

---

## üöÄ **UPDATED: Simplified User Journey**

### 1. **Landing ‚Üí Brand Details Page**
```
Current flow: URL ‚Üí Extract Brand ‚Üí Brand Details
New addition: On brand details page, add voice trait selection
```

### 2. **Enhanced Brand Details Page**
- **Keep existing**: Brand description, URL field  
- **ADD**: "Pick your three voice traits" section (12 trait pills)
- **Live preview**: As user selects traits, show relevant rules immediately
- **Sticky CTA**: "Generate style guide ‚Üí" appears when 3 traits selected

### 3. **Voice Trait Selection (Simplified)**
Based on v0 design - 12 predefined traits:
- **Bold, Human, Playful, Expert, Dry-humour, Warm**
- **Minimal, Quirky, Inspirational, Rebellious, Analytical, Wholesome**
- Each trait shows: Definition + Do/Don't lists + Before/After example
- User picks exactly 3, sees rules update in real-time

### 4. **Immediate Value Demo**
- **Trait selection** ‚Üí **Live rule preview** (instant)
- No complex questionnaire, no audit delays
- Users see exactly what they're buying before payment
- Rules shown as: Definition, Do/Don't bullets, example transformation

### 5. **Generate Full Style Guide**
- User clicks "Generate style guide" 
- Creates comprehensive PDF with their 3 selected traits + supporting rules
- Existing payment flow + PDF generation (no changes needed)

### 6. **Why This Works Better**
- **Faster time to value** - see rules in 30 seconds vs 3+ minutes
- **Builds on existing flow** - no major architecture changes
- **Immediate demonstration** - users see quality before paying
- **Simpler implementation** - no complex audit integration needed

## üõ† **UPDATED: Simplified Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Voice Trait Integration (Much Simpler)**

#### **Day 1-2: Extract Trait System from v0**
**File**: `components/voice-trait-selector.tsx` (new)
```typescript
interface VoiceTrait {
  name: string;
  definition: string;
  do: string[];
  dont: string[];
  example: string;
}

interface TraitSelectorProps {
  selectedTraits: string[];
  onTraitChange: (traits: string[]) => void;
  maxTraits: number; // = 3
}
```

**Features needed:**
- 12 predefined traits with full definitions
- Pill-style selection UI (max 3)
- Live rule preview as user selects
- Responsive 3-column grid layout

#### **Day 3: Integrate with Brand Details Page**

## üöÄ **Deployment Strategy**

### **Branch Strategy**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/copywriter-rebuild

# Development workflow
git checkout feature/copywriter-rebuild
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: add voice trait selector"
git push origin feature/copywriter-rebuild

# Weekly merges to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/copywriter-rebuild
git push origin main
```

### **Feature Flags**
```typescript
// Enable new flow gradually
const ENABLE_COPYWRITER_FLOW = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || 
                               process.env.ENABLE_COPYWRITER_FLOW === 'true';
```

### **A/B Testing Setup**
- 50% traffic to new trait flow
- 50% traffic to existing flow
- Compare conversion rates
- Gradual rollout based on performance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation (Updated)**

### **Technical Risks**
- **PDF generation errors**: Graceful degradation
- **Trait selector bugs**: Simple UI, easy to test
- **Performance issues**: Minimal, as no crawling or AI needed for main flow

### **User Experience Risks**

- **Mobile experience**: Responsive design priority

### **Business Risks**
- **Conversion drop**: A/B test before full rollout
- **User confusion**: Clear onboarding + help text
