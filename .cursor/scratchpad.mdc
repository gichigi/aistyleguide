# AI Style Guide Generator - Project Scratchpad

## üìã Project Overview
Web app that generates brand style guides from website URLs using AI to extract and analyze brand elements. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI API, and Stripe.

## üéØ Core User Journey
1. **Landing Page** ‚Üí Enter website URL or create manually
2. **Website Analysis** ‚Üí AI extracts brand info and autofills form
3. **Brand Details** ‚Üí User reviews/edits brand information  
4. **Preview** ‚Üí Shows partial style guide with paywall
5. **Payment** ‚Üí Stripe checkout for full access
6. **Email Capture** ‚Üí Collects email for thank you & abandoned cart recovery
7. **Full Access** ‚Üí Complete style guide with download options

## üöß Active Tasks

### High Priority (P0)

**üîΩ CRITICAL: Download Buttons Not Working**
- **Evidence**: Download modal shows format options but some buttons non-functional
- **Impact**: Users can't export their paid style guides in preferred formats
- **Severity**: Core feature failure affecting user experience post-payment
- **Investigation Needed**: Check which download formats are broken (PDF, Word, HTML, Markdown)

### Medium Priority (P1)  

**üìù CRITICAL: Generated Description Exceeds Validation Limit**
- **Problem**: AI-generated brand descriptions are sometimes too long for form validation
- **Impact**: Users must manually delete text from AI-generated content to proceed
- **User Experience**: Unacceptable - AI should generate content that fits our own validation
- **Evidence**: Brand details form shows validation error forcing users to edit AI output
- **Fix Required**: Either increase validation limit or constrain AI generation length
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between AI generation parameters and form validation rules

**üêõ Generation Retry Bug: Creates Apple Style Guide**
- **Problem**: When users get generation error and click retry, API generates Apple brand style guide instead of their brand
- **Evidence**: API logs show correct brand details but generates "Apple Style Rules" in response
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - needs investigation in retry flow and template processing
- **Impact**: Users get wrong content after paying for custom style guide
- **Files to investigate**: 
  - `app/payment/success/page.tsx` - retry function
  - `lib/template-processor.ts` - template rendering
  - `app/api/generate-styleguide/route.ts` - API processing

**üîó Webhook Configuration Issues** ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY FIXED**
- **Root Cause Found**: Environment variable mismatch - code defaulted to 'live' mode but used test keys
- **Fixed**: Added `STRIPE_MODE=test` and renamed variables to `STRIPE_TEST_*` pattern
- **Remaining Issues**:
  - Webhook signature validation still failing (400 error: "No signatures found matching expected signature")
  - Suggests webhook secret mismatch between local `.env` and Stripe dashboard
  - URL redirect from www to non-www may corrupt signatures during redirect
- **Evidence**: Test script shows 400 error from aistyleguide.com, 307 redirect from www version
- **Fixed**: 
  - ‚úÖ Environment variable naming (STRIPE_MODE=test, STRIPE_TEST_*)
  - ‚úÖ Webhook URL set to non-www version in Stripe dashboard
- **Still Failing**: 
  - Webhook signature validation (400 error persists)
  - **Likely Cause**: Webhook secret in `.env` doesn't match Stripe dashboard secret
- **Next Steps**: 
  - **CRITICAL**: Verify/regenerate webhook secret in Stripe dashboard
  - Update Vercel production environment variables to match local changes
  - Test with real Stripe webhook (not just test script)

### Low Priority (P2)

**Investigate Complete Guide Generation Performance**
- **Observation**: Complete guides make 2 sequential OpenAI calls (voice traits + style rules)
- **Impact**: Takes 60-90 seconds total, contributing to timeout issues
- **Consider**: Parallel generation or caching to reduce time
- **Note**: May not be a bug - could be intentional design for complete guides

### Done/Completed

**‚úÖ Fixed Critical P0 Issues - Major Payment & Generation Bugs (Jan 2025)**
- **$149 Complete Guide Race Condition**: Fixed React state timing issue where `setGuideType()` wasn't applied before `generateStyleGuide()` call - customers now get complete template
- **Apple Title Bug**: Removed hardcoded "Apple Style Rules" from AI prompts and post-processing - all guides now use correct brand names
- **Complete Guide Formatting**: Simplified AI prompts and reduced aggressive regex processing - complete guides now render cleanly like core guides
- **Brand Voice Traits**: Updated AI prompt to generate single adjective traits instead of phrases - improved readability and consistency
- **Orphaned Brackets CSS Fix**: Added `text-wrap: pretty` to prose paragraphs - prevents closing parentheses from appearing alone on new lines

**‚úÖ Fixed Payment Success Page UI (Jan 2025)**
- Improved payment success page user experience and messaging
- **Key Lessons**: UI should inform users about wait times and what they're getting

**‚úÖ Fixed Style Guide Generation Timeout (Jan 2025)**  
- Increased timeout from 30 seconds to 5 minutes for style guide generation
- **Key Lessons**: Frontend timeouts must account for backend AI processing times (60-90s for complete guides)

## üìö Key Lessons Learned

### Technical Architecture
- **Markdown rendering complexity** - `react-markdown` provides safer, more consistent rendering than `marked` + dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- **Plugin ecosystem** - `remark-breaks` solved line break issues more robustly than custom formatting functions
- **Template consistency is critical** - Always use shared components for uniform styling across all generated content
- **Type safety prevents runtime errors** - Add type guards before accessing AI responses

### User Experience  
- **Mobile-first + loading states** - Most users access on mobile, always provide feedback instead of blank screens
- **Payment UX strategy** - Static previews save OpenAI costs, full generation only post-payment
- **Error handling matters** - Generic errors cause user dropoff, need specific helpful messages

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI responses need validation** - Always check format, handle edge cases, use chunked generation
- **Cost optimization matters** - GPT-3.5 for extraction, GPT-4 for generation, 10k character limits
- **Model fallbacks** - Having backup models prevents complete failures

### Development Process
- **Incremental implementation** - Break complex changes into phases for testing and validation
- **Visual proof testing** - Side-by-side comparisons on test pages catch issues early
- **Data flow validation** - Test through all system layers before marking complete
- **T-shirt sizing works** - SMALL (30 min), MEDIUM (1-2 hours), LARGE (half day+) for realistic estimates
- **Test CLI first, then UI** - Faster feedback loop for API issues, easier debugging
- **Clean as you go** - Move completed tasks immediately to keep scratchpad focused

### React State & Race Conditions
- **Race Condition Pattern**: `setState()` is async - don't call functions immediately after that depend on the new state value. React batches state updates for performance, so the new value isn't available instantly
- **Race Condition Fix**: Pass values directly to functions instead of relying on state that may not be updated yet. E.g., `generateStyleGuide(paramValue)` instead of `setState(paramValue); generateStyleGuide()`
- **Debug Pattern**: When UI shows one thing but backend processes another, check for async state issues and parameter passing mismatches between frontend and API
- **React State Timing**: State updates don't happen immediately - they're queued and processed later in the React lifecycle

### Error Handling & Validation
- **Frontend validation > backend validation** - Better UX to block submission early vs show errors after
- **Context-specific error types** - Payment success page only needs 9 of 16 total error types
- **Smart retry > page reload** - 3x faster, preserves state, better analytics
- **Pre-filled support emails** - Include error context and timestamps for better support experience
- **Consistent error UX** - Same patterns across all pages build user confidence

### Project Management
- **1-line summaries > detailed histories** - Keep completed work concise and scannable
- **Break large tasks into small testable pieces** - Each step should have clear completion criteria
- **Visual feedback guides behavior** - Colors, disabled states help users understand what to do next
- **Fix at source > downstream processing** - Remove duplicate content from templates rather than filtering it later
