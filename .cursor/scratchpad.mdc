# AI Style Guide Generator - Project Scratchpad

## 📋 Project Overview
Web app that generates brand style guides from website URLs using AI to extract and analyze brand elements. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI API, and Stripe.

## 🎯 Core User Journey
1. **Landing Page** → Enter website URL or create manually
2. **Website Analysis** → AI extracts brand info and autofills form
3. **Brand Details** → User reviews/edits brand information  
4. **Preview** → Shows partial style guide with paywall
5. **Payment** → Stripe checkout for full access
6. **Email Capture** → Collects email for thank you & abandoned cart recovery
7. **Full Access** → Complete style guide with download options

## 🚧 Active Tasks

### High Priority (P0)

### Medium Priority (P1)  

### Low Priority (P2)

### Done/Completed
- ✅ Basic template system with core and complete options
- ✅ OpenAI integration for personalized content generation
- ✅ File export system (PDF, HTML, Markdown, Notion)
- ✅ Stripe payment integration with abandoned cart recovery
- ✅ Brand details extraction from website URLs
- ✅ Preview system for users to see sample content before purchasing

- ✅ Mobile-responsive design for all pages
- ✅ Error handling enhancement (Phase 1 complete)
- ✅ **Payment Success Error Handling** - Enhanced error messages, smart retry, support email integration for post-payment flow
- ✅ **Frontend Validation Enhancement** - 500-char limit blocks submission, prevents token errors upfront
- ✅ **Double Heading Fix** - Removed H1 from templates, StyleGuideHeader is now the single heading source
- ✅ **Major System Overhauls (2024-2025)** - Markdown rendering, brand flow simplification, email automation, UI/UX polish, core stabilization

## 📚 Key Lessons Learned

### Technical Architecture
- **Markdown rendering complexity** - `react-markdown` provides safer, more consistent rendering than `marked` + dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- **Plugin ecosystem** - `remark-breaks` solved line break issues more robustly than custom formatting functions
- **Template consistency is critical** - Always use shared components for uniform styling across all generated content
- **Type safety prevents runtime errors** - Add type guards before accessing AI responses

### User Experience  
- **Mobile-first + loading states** - Most users access on mobile, always provide feedback instead of blank screens
- **Payment UX strategy** - Static previews save OpenAI costs, full generation only post-payment
- **Error handling matters** - Generic errors cause user dropoff, need specific helpful messages

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI responses need validation** - Always check format, handle edge cases, use chunked generation
- **Cost optimization matters** - GPT-3.5 for extraction, GPT-4 for generation, 10k character limits
- **Model fallbacks** - Having backup models prevents complete failures

### Development Process
- **Incremental implementation** - Break complex changes into phases for testing and validation
- **Visual proof testing** - Side-by-side comparisons on test pages catch issues early
- **Data flow validation** - Test through all system layers before marking complete
- **T-shirt sizing works** - SMALL (30 min), MEDIUM (1-2 hours), LARGE (half day+) for realistic estimates
- **Test CLI first, then UI** - Faster feedback loop for API issues, easier debugging
- **Clean as you go** - Move completed tasks immediately to keep scratchpad focused

### Error Handling & Validation
- **Frontend validation > backend validation** - Better UX to block submission early vs show errors after
- **Context-specific error types** - Payment success page only needs 9 of 16 total error types
- **Smart retry > page reload** - 3x faster, preserves state, better analytics
- **Pre-filled support emails** - Include error context and timestamps for better support experience
- **Consistent error UX** - Same patterns across all pages build user confidence

### Project Management
- **1-line summaries > detailed histories** - Keep completed work concise and scannable
- **Break large tasks into small testable pieces** - Each step should have clear completion criteria
- **Visual feedback guides behavior** - Colors, disabled states help users understand what to do next
- **Fix at source > downstream processing** - Remove duplicate content from templates rather than filtering it later

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

### Short Term (Next 2 weeks)
- **Complete payment flow polish** - Status tracking, better UI, proper redirects
- **Content validation testing** - Ensure all generated content displays correctly
- **Performance monitoring setup** - Add logging for production debugging

### Medium Term (1-2 months)  
- **Editable Style Guides with Plate.js** - Allow users to edit generated content before download
- **Template variety** - Add different style guide formats and structures
- **Export enhancements** - Better PDF styling, additional formats (JSON, Figma)

### Long Term (3+ months)
- **Team collaboration features** - Share guides within organizations
- **API for developers** - Allow programmatic access to style guide generation
- **White-label solution** - Allow agencies to rebrand and resell the tool

### Future Ideas (6+ months)
- Advanced customization options (industry-specific templates, custom voice traits)
- Integration with design tools (Figma, Sketch)
- Multi-language support for international brands
- Team collaboration features (comments, suggestions, approval workflows)
- API for developers to integrate style guide generation into their tools
- Advanced analytics (content performance tracking, style guide usage metrics)
- Version control for style guides (track changes, rollback to previous versions)
- Bulk processing for multiple brands or sub-brands
- Custom branding for agencies (white-label solution)
- Advanced export options (InDesign, PowerPoint, Confluence)
