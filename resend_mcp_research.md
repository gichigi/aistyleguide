# Resend MCP Research: AI-Powered Email Writing and Deployment

## Executive Summary

**YES** - Resend has comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, allowing Cursor AI to write and deploy emails directly. This integration eliminates the need to copy-paste email content between applications.

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how AI applications connect to external systems and data sources. Think of it as a "USB-C port for AI applications" - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different tools and services.

### Key Benefits:
- **Standardized Integration**: One protocol works across different AI systems
- **Real-time Access**: AI can access up-to-date information and tools
- **Composable Architecture**: Multiple tools can work together seamlessly
- **Security**: Controlled access with user permission requirements

## Resend's MCP Implementation

### Official MCP Server
Resend provides an **official MCP server** that integrates with AI applications like Cursor and Claude Desktop.

**GitHub Repository**: `https://github.com/resend/mcp-send-email`
- ⭐ 359 stars, 47 forks
- Built with TypeScript
- Actively maintained by Resend team

### Features Available Through MCP

1. **Send plain text and HTML emails**
2. **Schedule emails for future delivery**
3. **Add CC and BCC recipients**
4. **Configure reply-to addresses**
5. **Customizable sender email** (requires domain verification)

## Integration with Cursor AI

### Setup Process

1. **Clone and Build the MCP Server**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/resend/mcp-send-email.git
   cd mcp-send-email
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Get Resend API Key**
   - Create free Resend account
   - Generate API key
   - Verify your domain (required for sending to external addresses)

3. **Configure Cursor**
   - Open Cursor Settings (`cmd+shift+p` → "Cursor Settings")
   - Navigate to MCP section
   - Add new global MCP server with this configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "resend": {
         "type": "command",
         "command": "node /absolute/path/to/build/index.js --key=YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Usage Workflow

1. **Write email content** in any format (markdown, plain text, etc.)
2. **Select all text** and press `cmd+l` to open Cursor chat
3. **Enable Agent mode** (dropdown in lower left)
4. **Tell Cursor**: "send this as an email"
5. **Cursor will**:
   - Understand the content
   - Format it appropriately 
   - Use Resend's MCP server to send the email
   - Handle all API interactions automatically

## Alternative MCP Servers

### Community Options
- **@pontusab/resend-mcp**: Community-maintained TypeScript server
- **Multiple implementations** available on platforms like Glama.ai

### Other Email MCP Servers
- **Gmail MCP Server**: For Gmail integration
- **Blastengine-mailer**: Alternative email service
- **General email sending MCPs**: Various community options

## Technical Architecture

### How It Works
1. **User writes email content** in Cursor
2. **Cursor AI processes** the content and intent
3. **MCP client** (built into Cursor) communicates with Resend MCP server
4. **Resend MCP server** formats the request and calls Resend API
5. **Email is sent** via Resend's infrastructure
6. **Confirmation** is returned to user through Cursor

### Communication Flow
```
User → Cursor AI → MCP Client → Resend MCP Server → Resend API → Email Sent
```

## Benefits for Email Workflow

### For Users
- **No copy-paste** between applications
- **AI-powered email composition** with context
- **Automatic formatting** (HTML/plain text)
- **Seamless sending** without leaving development environment
- **Professional email delivery** via Resend's infrastructure

### For Developers
- **Rapid prototyping** of email-enabled applications
- **Consistent email handling** across projects
- **Professional deliverability** without managing email infrastructure
- **Integration with existing AI workflows**

## Use Cases

### Development Workflows
- **Automated reports** from code analysis
- **Build notifications** sent via AI
- **Error reporting** with AI-generated summaries
- **Documentation updates** sent to teams

### Business Applications
- **AI-generated newsletters** 
- **Personalized customer communications**
- **Automated follow-up emails**
- **Data-driven email campaigns**

### Personal Productivity
- **AI-assisted email drafting**
- **Scheduled email sending**
- **Context-aware communications**
- **Multi-format email creation**

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **User approval required** for all email sending operations
- **API key management** through secure configuration
- **Domain verification** required for external sending
- **Isolated server processes** for security

### Best Practices
- **Environment variable storage** for API keys
- **Restricted sender domains** for security
- **User consent** for all email operations
- **Audit logging** of email activities
