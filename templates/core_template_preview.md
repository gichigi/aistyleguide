## How to Use This Document  
This document outlines the rules for brand voice, spelling, grammar, and formatting across all content channels. Anyone writing and publishing content for {{brand_name}} should follow these guidelines.  

✍🏽 ## General tips  

📱 ### Short content  
_social, ads, web snippets_  

**Write like a human**: use everyday language and avoid jargon.  
**Be an authority**: sound confident and optimistic; show you know what you’re talking about.  
**Be brief**: aim for 10‑15 words per sentence. Use short, familiar words. Use 2‑3 sentence paragraphs.  

📄 ### Long content  
_blogs, newsletters, articles_  

**Use bullet lists**: for three or more points so ideas stand out.  
**Humanise the story**: start with why it matters now, then show the solution.  
**Use line breaks & white space**: Use line breaks liberally for spacing and readability.  
**Break up with sub‑heads**: draft first, add headings after; strong headings keep readers engaged.  
**Use figures thoughtfully**: the brain notices numerals; lead with key figures but don’t overload the reader.
